## Building Your First Big Data Application on AWS

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Download the Presentation [First-Big-Data-App.pdf]() which contains the workshop overview and attendee instuctions for building the application.

2. Apply the AWS usage credits to your AWS Account. Log into your AWS account and click on your name on the upper right corner and select "My Account from the menu. On the left side of the My Account page, select "Credits" and enter the code you were given.

3. Navigate to the [Scripts & CloudFormation page](https://tinyurl.com/y6v2hjuz) 

4. Download the Workshop Scripts zip by clicking on the link. You will use these SQL and Python scripts when building your application.

5. Run the AWS CloudFormation template to create the AWS resources refered to as the 'CloudFormation Stack' used in this workshop. Remember when you are done to delete the CloudFormation Stack to ensure that you stop incurring charges for these AWS resources.

Note: The template will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. While that's running the instructor will walk you through the overview presentation to familiarize you with the application you will build and the AWS services used.

6. Once the instructor has completed the overview, use the remaining presentation slides to build the application.

7. Remember when you are done to delete the CloudFormation stack to remove the workshop resources from your account so that you won't incur additional charges.
